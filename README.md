# TwitterPoliticalAmplification

This repository contains the Twitter profiles and Left-Right scores that we used in the paper **'Did the Right go down with the rest of Twitter?: A Global Audit on Twitter's Political Amplification in the Musk Era'**. This is an anonumous repository created for the purpose of double blind submission. This data will be shifted to our main github account, after the paper submission process is over.

## Data folders

* The folder politcians_names contains the csv files that have the Twitter Profiles that we used in our analysis.
* The folder lr_files contain the Left-Right ideologies assigned to the politicians.

All of this data is collected by us for the purpose of this paper.
